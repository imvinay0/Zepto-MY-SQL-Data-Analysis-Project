# 🛒 Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project 
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database
✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:
- sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)
- name: Product name as it appears on the app
- category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.
- mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)
- discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP
- discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)
- availableQuantity: Units available in inventory
- weightInGms: Product weight in grams
- outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability
- quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

## 🔧 Project Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

### 1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);

### 2. Data Import
Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

### 3. 🔍 Data Exploration
- Counted the total number of records in the dataset
- Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content
- Checked for null values across all columns
- Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
- Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts
- Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

### 4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero
Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

### 5. 📊 Business Insights
- Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
- Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
- Estimated potential revenue for each product category
- Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount
- Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
- Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
- Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
- Measured total inventory weight per product category
